# 20240 - Slingy Shawty Pedro + NextFTC Quickstart - Ishaan D
Hi peoples this made by Ishaan D
Check out **NextFTC folder** everything else is 100% tuning for pedro. Autonomous is ***AutonConcept.java***

This is a Pedro + NextFTC quickstart where there is example code on autonomous(pretty good) and teleOp(sorta chopped but it works)
I have created subsystems classes for each mech and made the autonomous around that. There is also a class called autonSequences which includes common Commands used for Auton


Check out the roadrunner quickstart too
